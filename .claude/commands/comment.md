Add clear, concise comments to the code in the current file or selection.

Guidelines:
- Add JSDoc comments for functions and components explaining purpose, params, and return values
- Add inline comments only where logic is non-obvious
- Keep comments brief and focused on "why" not "what"
- Match existing code style and comment conventions
- Don't over-comment obvious code
